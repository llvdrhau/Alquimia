# Alquimia

This code presents the implementation of the Alquimia project which aims to integrate metabolic models within a 
superstructure optimization framework. The code is written in Python and uses the [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)
to generate the superstructure and [GAMs](https://www.gams.com/) to solve the optimization problem. 

The publication of this work can be found in the following link: [Advancing Biorefinery Design through the Integration 
of Metabolic Models in Superstructure Optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369703X21002554)

The code is structured in the following way:
- file: *'case study propionate'* contains the code to generate the superstructure for the propionate case studies
  - 'case_study_v1.py' contains the code to generate and solve the superstructure of case study 1 
  - 'case_study_v2.gms' contains the code to generate and solve the superstructure of case study 2
- file: *'json models'* contains the surrogate models for the case studies
- file: *'SBML models'* contains the SBML models (GEMs) for the case studies
- file: *'SBML screening'* contains scripts for the curration of the sbml models
- file: *'excel files'* contains the Excel files with the data for the case studies
- scripts to build the superstructures and surrogate models
  - f_make_super_structure.py: contains the classes and functions to generate the superstructure
  - f_make_surrogate_models.py: contains the classes and functions to generate the surrogate models
  - f_screen_SBML.py: contains the classes and functions to screen the sbml models
